# Project Memory - Build Fixes

## Issues Fixed (Date: Current)

### 1. Main Build Error - authOptions Import
**Problem**: Dashboard page was trying to import `authOptions` from the NextAuth route file, but it wasn't exported.
**Solution**: Changed import to use `AuthController.getAuthOptions()` directly from the controller.

### 2. ESLint Configuration Issues
**Problem**: ESLint was not properly configured for Next.js and React, causing JSX scope errors.
**Solution**: 
- Replaced `eslint.config.mjs` with traditional `.eslintrc.json`
- Used `next/core-web-vitals` configuration
- Disabled `react/react-in-jsx-scope` rule (not needed in Next.js 13+)

### 3. Server Component with Client State
**Problem**: Home page was using Zustand store in a server component, causing `useSyncExternalStore` error.
**Solution**: Added `"use client"` directive to make it a client component.

### 4. Navigation Link Issues
**Problem**: Using `<a>` tags instead of Next.js `<Link>` components for internal navigation.
**Solution**: Replaced anchor tags with Next.js Link components in dashboard and signin pages.

### 5. Lockfile Warning
**Problem**: Multiple lockfiles detected causing npm warnings.
**Solution**: Removed duplicate lockfile from parent directory.

## Current Status
✅ Build passes successfully
✅ ESLint passes with no warnings or errors
✅ All TypeScript types are valid
✅ Ready for Vercel deployment

## Next Steps
- Deploy to Vercel
- Set up environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- Test authentication flow in production
